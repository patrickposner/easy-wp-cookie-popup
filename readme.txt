= What is GDPR? =

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a European regulation to strengthen and unify the data protection of EU citizens. (https://www.eugdpr.org/)

= GDPR and Cookie Compliance =

GDPR states that as a website owner, you cannot assume a user has opted into the cookies being used on your website – the user must give a positive opt in or “affirmative action” to signal their consent to the use of cookies and you also cannot force users to opt into the use of cookies.
Users who do not give consent should have the same experience of your website as those who give consent, which means you have to provide the same level of service and experience to those who do not accept the cookies.
Consent will need to be specific to the different cookie purposes with the ability to enable and disable cookies at a granular level for each cookie.
It also means that you should not be tracking users on your website with tools such as Google Analytics until they give you a specific permission to do so.

== GPDR-Compliance ==

Cookimise not autmatically makes your site GDRP-compliant. Please seek independent legal adivce since GPDR is a very unique topic for each website.

=== CODING STANDARDS MADE IN GERMANY ===

The plugin is coded with **modern PHP** and **WordPress standards** in mind. It’s fully OOP code. It’s highly extendable for developers threw several action and filter hooks.
Quickster keep your store performance in mind. Every script is **loaded conditionally** and all input and output data is secured.
